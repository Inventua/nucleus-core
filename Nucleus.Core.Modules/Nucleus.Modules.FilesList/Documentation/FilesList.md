## Files List module
The files list module displays a list of files from a selected folder. The end user must have "Browse" permission for the 
selected folder.  If the user does not have permission to browse the files, or there are no files in the folder, nothing is displayed.  The 
displayed files are restricted to the selected folder - the module does not display sub-folders or their contents and does not provide 
folder navigation controls.
