# Nucleus.Data.Common
Nucleus.Data.Common includes base classes and interfaces used to implement a data provider for Nucleus, or for a Nucleus extension.  Most extensions developed for Nucleus
should reference the Nucleus.Data.EntityFramework package rather than this package, but if you are implementing a data provider which does not use
Entity Framework, you can use this package.
