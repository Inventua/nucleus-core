The *default-2-column* layout contains:
- a banner pane named `BannerPane` at the top.
- a main display area in the middle with a left pane named `LeftPane` on the left and a main body pane named `ContentPane`.
- a bottom pane named `BottomPane`.  

The `BannerPane` contains the site logo, user account control, site menu and breadcrumb control, and you can add additional modules if you need to.  The 
`BottomPane` contains a site terms and privacy policy control (if you have configured a site terms and privacy policy page for your site), and you can add 
additional modules if you need to.  

The *default-2-column* layout is generally used when you want to display a list of links in the `LeftPane` alongside your main content.  If you don't put 
anything in the `LeftPane`, it is not displayed, so you can use this layout as your main layout.
