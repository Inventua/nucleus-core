@*
	This layout is used when rendering settings pages & any other time a module or extension controller renders a view.  Its purpose is to make the 
	Html.AddScript and Html.AddStyle helpers work properly when the _Layout layout is not in use.  It causes the style and link elements which are
	rendered by .RenderStyles and .RenderScripts to be rendered within the output <body> rather than in the <head>, because is handles cases where
	we are rendering a html fragment.

	Refer to ../_ViewStart.cshtml for more information.
