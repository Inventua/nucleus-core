## Shadow module
The Shadow Module displays a copy of a module from another page.  This allows the user to share content across pages.

If the module is not configured, and the logged-on user has module editing permissions, a "This Shadow module 
is not configured" warning is displayed.  If the user does not have edit permissions, the module is not displayed.

Users must have view permission for both the Shadow module, and for the module which is being displayed.  If the
user does not have view permission, the module is not displayed.
