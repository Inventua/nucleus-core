- The *BannerPane* at the top contains your site logo, and the user account, site menu, and breadcrumb controls.  You can add additional modules.
- The *ContentPane* is the main area for modules.  It shows a scroll bar if the content does not fit.
- The *BottomPane* at the bottom contains a link to your site terms and privacy policy pages (if configured).  You can add additional modules, and if the pane doesn't contain any content it is suppressed. 

Use this layout to display a list of links or other content in the *LeftPane* alongside your main content.
