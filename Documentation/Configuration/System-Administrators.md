## System Administrators
System Administrators can view and edit all pages and modules, and can manage system settings.  The first system administrator user account is created by 
the setup wizard.  If you need to create additional system administrator accounts, after logging in as a system administrator, clicking the
`Settings` button to display the Settings control panel, click `System Administrators`, then click `New User`.

System Administrators don't have user profile values or roles, just a user name and password.
