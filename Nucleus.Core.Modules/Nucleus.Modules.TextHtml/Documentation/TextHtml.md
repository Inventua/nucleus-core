## Text/HTML module
The Text/HTML module displays HTML or text content.  

The editor is similar to other rich text editors.  You can set formatting, bold/italic, insert links to other web sites, page links and image 
links, and add lists.  If you need to edit Html content directly, click the `<>` button.
