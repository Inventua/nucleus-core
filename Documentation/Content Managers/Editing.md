## Editing Content
You can edit your content or module settings by clicking the `Edit Content` button at the bottom-left of the page.  This will enable editing mode, which will 
display a border around each module, and will enable editing controls.  The editing controls appear when you hover over your module content.

Use the editing controls to edit content in a popup dialog, edit settings, move the module or delete a module.  You can also edit content using the 
`Edit Page Settings` button or by clicking `Pages`, navigating to your page and choosing the `Modules` tab.  Use the page settings page to add new modules.

### Inline Editing
When edit mode is on, you can edit your module title by clicking in it and typing.  If your module is a Html module, or another module type which supports 
inline editing, you can make simple changes to content by clicking your text and typing.

### Moving Modules
Click and drag the ![Move](Editing-move.png) button to move your module to another pane, or if the modules current pane contains more than one module, to 
change the order in which the modules are displayed.
