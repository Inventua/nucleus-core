## Google Analytics Extension
The Google Analytics extension adds elements to your page output to report analytics data to Google Analytics.

> The Google Analytics extension provides an interface to Google Analytics, but you must set up a 
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) site first.  You will need your Google Analytics measurement 
ID from the Google Analytics site.

The Google Analytics extension settings are accessed in the `Manage` control panel.
