Nucleus CMS is an open-source .NET Core/MVC-based web application framework and content management system. 

Use Nucleus for your site or web application to take advantage of built-in and third party extensions, and [extend](https://www.nucleus-cms.com/developers/) the system by creating new layouts, modules, web applications and other components.  Nucleus CMS includes content modules (Text/Html, Static Content, Documents, Links, Multi-Content, Media and Publish), optional extensions (Elastic Search, Azure Blob Storage, Google Analytics and OAuth client) as well as navigation and utility modules.  

Optional and third-party extensions are installed by end users from within a web browser, with no special skills or software tools required, and do not require that Nucleus be re-compiled.
